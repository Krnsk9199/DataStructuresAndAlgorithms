     *  1. A Graph is a non-linear data structure and non-hierarchical in nature.
     *  2. Maps , Networking , Operating System are the application of the Graphs.
     *  3. In trees , there is a structure , hierarchy , parents and  children but graphs there is
     *  no structure. Everyone are just connected or not connected . Tree is a special kind of graph
     *  4. Connected Graph : In connect graph , there is a path from any point to any other point in the
     *  graph.
     *  5. A Tree is a non cycle graph .
     *  6. Forest is a group of trees.
     *  7. Spanning Tree : If we remove any one edge from this graph, it becomes disconnected .
     *  therefore it is a spanning tree.
     *  A graph can have multiple spanning trees.
     *  8. A Complete graph : It is graph that has a edge between every single vertex in the graph. (Kn)
     *  9. No of edges in a tree is (n-1).
     *  10. No of edges in a complete graph is n(n-1)/2 .
     *  11. Connected graph ranges from n-1 <= ____ <=nc2
     *  12. No of odd degree vertices in a graph is even.
     *  13. Sum of all degrees in a graph is even.
     *  14. In an undirected graph no of edges is v(v-1)/2.
     *
     *                         ...............
     *
     *  Graph Implementation :
     *  There are three ways of implementing graph :
     *  1. Edge List ---- Space complexity : 0(n+E)
     *  2. Adjacency List ---- Space complexity : 0(V+2E)
     *  3. Adjacency Matrix ---- Space complexity : 0(n*n)
